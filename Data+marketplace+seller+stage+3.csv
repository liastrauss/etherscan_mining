Under normal conditions, this would stop me from experimenting with the market because I do not understand what reason a browser addon would have to consume such a high amount of CPU and RAM usage. The marketplace itself was quite simple to use. But I still fail to understand what the purpose is. I could see this as being useful if I were selling private information on a blackmarket, but I fail to see what interest a buyer would have in knowing random details of an unknown person.
